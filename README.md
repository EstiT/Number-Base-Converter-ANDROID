# Number-Base-Converter-ANDROID

In the text field, use either o, t, or d (for octal, ternary, and decimal) to specify what number base the 
inputed number is in. 
A colon follows the single letter and then the number to be converted. 
Examples of acceptable input: d:9532 o:63 t:121

Afterwards, tap the button of the base that the input is to be converted to.

Unacceptable input will result in an error displayed.
